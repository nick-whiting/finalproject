<h1>Linux Distro Performance Comparison & Website Creation</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my project page documenting the performance comparison of Four Linux
        distributions and the Creation of my First Website!</p>
    <p>On this Website I will be detailing the steps I took towards
        completing my final project for CIS 100. I will be Comparing the 
        performance of multiple Linux Distros on a single PC while also
        creating a website (this one) to document the process.</p>
<h2>The Foundations of a Website</h2>
<p>first things first, lets make a website. Establishing a good Git
    Workflow (adding, staging, and finalizing changes) is key to any 
    project, as it allows you to keep track of changes and
    revert to previous versions if needed.</p>

<p>Here, I am creating a local (on my computer) directory (folder) with
    a text document containing, well, this; the raw information for a
    website. Once that's done, you initialize the folder as a Git
    repository using the git init command, creating a hidden .git folder
    that tracks changes in that folder you're in. After that, you link
    the folder to a remote repository on GitHub and upload your changes with a push command
    to GitHub. Finally, you can view that information as a website using
    GitHub Pages by enabling it in the repository settings.</p>
<h2>Partitioning a Hard Drive for Multiple Distros</h2>
    <p>Now let's get down to business. In this step we'll be taking a 
    completely wiped out computer with nothing other than a bios on it,
    and using each distro's installer, partition a piece of the unused hard
    drive for each distro to use. In the end we will have four separate
    operating systems, on one computer. The four Distros I'll be Installing are:</p>
    <ul><li>Linux Mint Cinnimon</li>
        <li>Fedora</li>
        <li>openSUCE</li>
        <li>Linux Mint Xfce </li></ul> 
    <p>The first step to all this is to get each Distro on a mountable medium,
    this will allow us to boot the computer (using the bios) from that
    medium and begin our installation process. The medium i used to mount
    each Distros ISO on was a flash drive; Tho other mediums (like CDs)
    can obviously be used.</p>
<h2>Installing The Distros</h2>
    <p>Now we need to partition our EFI, this is a smaller piece of the harddrive
    that we will put each distros bootloader on. We can tell all the Distros
    to share this partition, so we only need to make it once.</p>

    class="styled-image">
<p>Once we have our EFI partitioned, we can get started on the long
    but simple task of installing our distros. First we will put our flash
    drive into the computer and shut it down. Once we power up our pc into
    the bios, we can boot up through our flash drive, accessing each
    Distros Instillation program.</p>

    class="styled-image">
    <p>After partitioning a piece of our drive for the distro to use as
    its root, we just need to point the distro to where the EFI is so it
    can install its bootloader there. Once thats all said and done it
    will begin its instalation process and thats it! Now all thats left
    is to repeat the process until we have all the distros we would like to
    have on the PC.</p>

<h2>Accessing the Bootloader</h2>
<P>If we did everything properly with pointing each distro to our one 
    EFI partition, we should be able to access each distro when we boot 
    up our computer, launching the bootloader. in our case, the GRUB

<h2>Comparing each Distros Performance using an In-browser Benchmark</h2>
<p>We will be using the default distros system monitor that each distro
    provides to compair their performance while running an in-browser
    benchmark (<a href="https://www.wirple.com/bmark/"target="_blank">Wirple Benchmark</a>)
    to stress the hardware. I will also be giving a live demo
    of this process for one of the distributions as my presintation in class.</p>
    <p>The Results:</p>
    <p>Linux Mint Cinnamon</p>

<h2>Conclusion of test</h2>
<p>all in all the test goes through 4 diffrent benchmarks to stress the computer</p>
<ul><li>Increasing Quantity of blocks until FPS drop below 10</li>
    <li>Rendering Two Spheres</li>
    <li>Rendering Two Spheres with extra lights, particles shadows, etc.</li>
    <li>Using lights, particles, opacity, reflections, and antialiasing</li></ul>
    <p>Once the process is over, the Benchmark Pumps out a score:</p>
    <ul><li>Linux Mint Cinnimon - 1474</li>
        <li>Fedora - 641</li>
        <li>openSUCE - 1222</li>
        <li>Linux Mint Xfce - 1603</li></ul> 
        <p>Given the results as well as my own observations during the test,
            it was clear that both Linux Mint Xfce and OpenSUCE took the
            longest in the Cube test to drop below 10 FPS. Many factors
            may have also played a role in the results, like taking a Screenshot
            needing to be a program that wants to open during each test,
            clearly affecting the results. In the end, I still believe the lighter
            weight distros like Linux Mint Xfce and OpenSUCE "felt" the fastest, and
            the project was a sucess as my old piece of junk laptop actually made it
            through the experiment.</p>
