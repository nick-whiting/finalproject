<h1>Linux Distro Performance Comparison & Website Creation</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my project page documenting the performance comparison of Four Linux
        distributions and the Creation of my First Website!</p>
    <p>On this Website I will be detailing the steps I took towards
        completing my final project for CIS 100. I will be Comparing the 
        performance of multiple Linux Distros on a single PC while also
        creating a website (this one) to document the process.</p>
<h2>The Foundations of a Website</h2>
<p>first things first, lets make a website. Establishing a good Git
    Workflow (adding, staging, and finalizing changes) is key to any 
    project, as it allows you to keep track of changes and
    revert to previous versions if needed.</p>

<p>Here, I am creating a local (on my computer) directory (folder) with
    a text document containing, well, this; the raw information for a
    website. Once that's done, you initialize the folder as a Git
    repository using the git init command, creating a hidden .git folder
    that tracks changes in that folder you're in. After that, you link
    the folder to a remote repository on GitHub and upload your changes with a push command
    to GitHub. Finally, you can view that information as a website using
    GitHub Pages by enabling it in the repository settings.</p>
<h2>Partitioning a Hard Drive for Multiple Distros</h2>
    <p>this is the part where i installed all the distros, i guess right
        now ive come to the conclusion that the best thing for me to do is basically write
       an outline for my website and this process, like with an english essay, huh, 
   go figgure. so now i am countinuing creating my website over time</p>
<h2>this is the heading for the 4th part</h2>
    <p>heres the text for the 4th part</p>
    <ul><li>Linux Mint Cinnimon</li>
    <li>Fedora</li>
    <li>openSUCE</li>
    <li>Linux Mint Xfce </li></ul> 
<h2>This is the 5th Heading</h2>
<P>heading 4 text and images</P>
<h2>This is the 6th Heading</h2>
    <ul><li>Download the ISO file for the desired Linux distribution.</li>
    <li>Create a bootable USB drive using tools like Rufus or Etcher.</li>
    <li>Boot from the USB drive and start the installation process.</li>
    <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to partition the hard drive.</li>
    <li>Complete the installation and reboot the system.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process for each distribution you want to install.</li></ul>
<h2>This is the 6th Heading</h2>
<p>i will be using the stock hardware monitors that each distro
    may provide to see their performance live during my presintation 
    while using a website for displaying 3d graphics as stress,
    like at <a href="https://www.wirple.com/bmark/"

    and <a href="https://webglsamples.org/aquarium/aquarium.html"
