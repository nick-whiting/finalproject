<h1>Linux Distro Performance Comparison & Website Creation</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my project page documenting the performance comparison of four Linux
        distributions and the creation of my first website!</p>
    <p>On this website, I will detail the steps I took towards
        completing my final project for CIS 100. I will be comparing the 
        performance of multiple Linux distros on a single PC while also
        creating a website (this one) to document the process.</p>
<h2>The Foundations of a Website</h2>
<p>First things first, let’s make a website. Establishing a good Git
    workflow (adding, staging, and finalizing changes) is key to any 
    project, as it allows you to keep track of changes and
    revert to previous versions if needed.</p>

<p>Here, I am creating a local (on my computer) directory (folder) with
    a text document containing, well, this—the raw information for a
    website. Once that's done, you initialize the folder as a Git
    repository using the <code>git init</code> command, creating a hidden .git folder
    that tracks changes in that folder. After that, you link
    the folder to a remote repository on GitHub and upload your changes with a <code>push</code> command
    to GitHub. Finally, you can view that information as a website using
    GitHub Pages by enabling it in the repository settings.</p>
<h2>Partitioning a Hard Drive for Multiple Distros</h2>
    <p>Now let's get down to business. In this step, we'll be taking a 
    completely wiped-out computer with nothing other than a BIOS on it
    and using each distro's installer to partition a piece of the unused hard
    drive for each distro to use. In the end, we will have four separate
    operating systems on one computer. The four distros I'll be installing are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linux Mint Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Fedora</li>
        <li>openSUSE</li>
        <li>Linux Mint Xfce</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>The first step in all this is to get each distro on a mountable medium.
    This will allow us to boot the computer (using the BIOS) from that
    medium and begin our installation process. The medium I used to mount
    each distro's ISO on was a flash drive, though other mediums (like CDs)
    can also be used.</p>
<h2>Installing the Distros</h2>
    <p>Now we need to partition our EFI. This is a smaller piece of the hard drive
    where we will put each distro's bootloader. We can tell all the distros
    to share this partition, so we only need to make it once.</p>

<p>Once we have our EFI partitioned, we can get started on the long
    but simple task of installing our distros. First, we will put our flash
    drive into the computer and shut it down. Once we power up our PC into
    the BIOS, we can boot through our flash drive, accessing each
    distro's installation program.</p>

    class="styled-image">
    <p>After partitioning a piece of our drive for the distro to use as
    its root, we just need to point the distro to where the EFI is so it
    can install its bootloader there. Once that's all said and done, it
    will begin its installation process—and that's it! Now all that's left
    is to repeat the process until we have all the distros we want
    installed on the PC.</p>

<h2>Accessing the Bootloader</h2>
<p>If we did everything properly by pointing each distro to our one 
    EFI partition, we should be able to access each distro when we boot 
    up our computer by launching the bootloader—in our case, GRUB.</p>

<h2>Comparing Each Distro's Performance Using an In-Browser Benchmark</h2>
<p>We will be using the default system monitor that each distro
    provides to compare their performance while running an in-browser
    benchmark (<a href="https://www.wirple.com/bmark/" target="_blank">Wirple Benchmark</a>)
    to stress the hardware. I will also be giving a live demo
    of this process for one of the distributions as my presentation in class.</p>
    <p>The Results:</p>
    <p>Linux Mint Cinnamon</p>

<h2>The Experiment's Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, the test goes through four different benchmarks to stress the computer:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Increasing quantity of blocks until FPS drops below 10</li>
    <li>Rendering two spheres</li>
    <li>Rendering two spheres with extra lights, particles, shadows, etc.</li>
    <li>Using lights, particles, opacity, reflections, and anti-aliasing</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the process is over, the benchmark provides a score:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Linux Mint Cinnamon - 1474</li>
    <li>Fedora - 641</li>
    <li>openSUCE - 1222</li>
    <li>Linux Mint Xfce - 1603</li></ul> 
    <p>Given the results, as well as my own observations during the test,
        it was clear that both Linux Mint Xfce and openSUSE took the longest
        in the Cube test to drop below 10 FPS. Many factors may have also
        played a role in the results, such as taking a screenshot, which
        required a program to open during the test, clearly affecting the
        results.</p>
        <p>In the end, I still believe the lighter-weight distros
        like Linux Mint Xfce and openSUSE "felt" the fastest, and that the
        project was a huge success. I learned more than I could have ever imagined 
        and my old piece of junk laptop actually made it
        through the experiment.</p>
