    <p>Here you are creating a local(on your computer) directory (folder) with a text document containing, well, this; the raw information for a website. once thats done, you mark the folder as a Repository for githubs sake, creating a hidden file thats a snapshot of that folder your in, as well as where to save the updates you make to that folder (directory). After that, you just upload that info with a push command to github, and view that info as a website using pages." </p>
